Index configuration for PUL and rake tasks for Solr Indexing
=====================================

Run tests with `rspec`

Versions:
* JRuby 1.7.25
* Traject 2.3.0

**Note**: The Traject functionality can also be called within Bibdata.
There is a second Gemfile in this directory to allow the indexing tasks to
run on JRuby, which allows for multi-threaded processing.
