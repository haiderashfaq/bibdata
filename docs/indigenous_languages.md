### Workflow to update Indigenous Language lists
1. A request will come from the metadata librarians or catalogers, either via a Github ticket or through Slack
1. They will provide you with a link to a Google Sheets document
    * Ensure that everyone on the team who will need access to the sheet can at least view it
    * The document should include:
        * A sheet with language codes
        * A sheet with LCSH (Library of Congress
          Subject Headings)
1. Download the Language code and LCSH sheets as
CSV files (currently File-->Download-->Comma
Separated Values (.csv)) and move them into place.
